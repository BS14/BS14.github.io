# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a DevOps Engineer based in Nepal and have been in the IT industry for the past six years.

I have always been fascinated with DevOps and enjoy optimizing and automating the software development and deployment process to solve real-world problems. In my free time, I like to stay up-to-date with the latest DevOps trends and technologies, attend local meetups and conferences, and collaborate with other DevOps professionals.
